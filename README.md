Does Idle Startup Tycoon have an ending?
The goal of Idle Startup Tycoon is to make as much money as you can. There is no clear and defined end, you really just keep on going until you don’t want to anymore. But if you play long enough, the numbers might start to look a little strange. Despite there being no distinct endpoint, you’ll likely find that you don’t really need one. If you love idle games, then you will almost for sure be a fan of Idle Startup Tycoon.

What is the advantage of starting a new floor?
Starting a new floor in Idle Startup Tycoon is expensive, there are no arguments against that. However, with every floor you build, you get a new source of income. Along with this, the businesses that are on the higher floors produce more revenue. Pretty much whenever you can afford it, buy the floor above you. At first, it may be expensive, but you’ll earn back the money you spend pretty quickly and start making some serious profit. 

What does resetting do in Idle Startup Tycoon?
Resetting is a pivotal part of Idle Startup Tycoon. As players begin to make money, they will eventually receive an offer from an investor. Once you accept the offer, your game will reset, and all of your money and progress will be lost. While this seems like a bad move, it actually is to your benefit.

Once players reset, they will receive more money for each conversion, as well as start out with more initial money. You will find that it will take you almost no time to get back to where you were before restarting. After a couple of resets, you will be making trillions of dollars from your startup companies in no time!
