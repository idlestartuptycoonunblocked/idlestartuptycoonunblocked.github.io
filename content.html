                      <h3>
                        Getting Started
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        In <strong><a href="https://idlestartuptycoonunblocked.github.io/">Idle Startup Tycoon Unblocked</a></strong>, you begin in a small office focused on the food delivery app industry. Your first task is to click on the programmer to generate money, which you then pass to the engineer. The engineer will convert this into sales, which you can deposit by clicking on the salesperson. This simple yet engaging mechanic keeps you involved in the growth of your startup.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As you accumulate wealth, you'll have the opportunity to hire managers who enhance productivity, unlock new floors for additional businesses, and recruit more workers. Whenever you see a green arrow, click it to upgrade your workers and businesses for optimal performance.

                      <h3>
                        The Goal
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Your aim in <strong><a href="https://idlestartuptycoonunblocked.github.io/">Idle Startup Tycoon Unblocked</a></strong> is to reach 179.77DT dollars to win the game. However, there is no definitive endpoint; the game continues as long as you wish to play. If you're busy, you can leave the game running in the background and return later to find that your employees have been hard at work, generating significant cash flow.
                      </p>
                      <h3>
                        Expanding Your Business
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Starting a new floor in <strong><a href="https://idlestartuptycoonunblocked.github.io/">Idle Startup Tycoon Unblocked</a></strong> may seem costly, but each new floor provides an additional source of income. Higher floors tend to produce more revenue, making it a smart investment whenever you can afford it. As you expand into other fields like mobile gaming, you'll need to purchase coworking spaces on new floors to maximize your profits.
                      </p>
                      <h3>
                        The Reset Mechanism
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Resetting is a crucial feature in <strong><a href="https://idlestartuptycoonunblocked.github.io/">Idle Startup Tycoon Unblocked</a></strong>. After accumulating enough wealth, you'll receive an investment offer that prompts a reset of your game progress. While this may seem disadvantageous at first—resulting in lost money and progress—it actually benefits you by increasing your earnings per conversion and providing more starting capital for your next venture.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With each reset, you'll find that returning to your previous financial status becomes quicker and easier. Before long, you'll be raking in trillions of dollars from your thriving startup companies!
                      </p>
